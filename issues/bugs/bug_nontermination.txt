// All following bugs are likely related to transitive closures around id.

// (1) Simple non-termination

assert id+ <= 0

// (2) Non-termination while generating a node with unboundedly many children (over 50k within seconds)

assert (co | id)+ <= 0

// (3) Non-terminating variant of above (same behaviour but slower growth rate).

assert (co & (loc |Â id))+ <= 0
